<font size=5>diandaokongge is the Chinese pinyin of 颠倒空格. </font>
### What is 颠倒空格? 颠倒空格 is a special symbol that can reverse the text after it on the same line, and it is in the form of space, so it is called: `颠倒空格`. I'm not going to give 颠倒空格 for you.  
#### Who came up with the name "颠倒空格"? I forgot. It was in August 2020 that an extracurricular classmate sent me three strange spaces in Classin App, and attached the usage method. I forgot the name of the first one. It is a bug that uses Classin App. After sending it, it will leave a large blank in the chat area. The second is 颠倒空格. The third one is what I don't remember at all. Because C\*\*\*\*\*n also circulated upside-down spaces before, but there was no name, so I would like to sincerely thank the classmate who gave me upside-down spaces and names the upside-down spaces, even though I even forgot who he was .
